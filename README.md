<h1>Business Sales Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Caliber Supplies is a trusted retailer of high-quality office products. Over the years, consumer spending behaviors have undergone significant changes, creating a corresponding shift in businesses' sales tactics. In light of this, Caliber Supplies is embarking on the launch of a new product line. However, launching such a line can be expensive, prompting the company to seek the most cost-effective techniques for its sales endeavors. The company has tested three different sales strategies: email, phone calls, and the combination of email and phone calls, to sell the new product line. The company wants to know the differences in performance among the three sales methods and which sales strategy among the three is the best?

## STEPS OVERVIEW:

1) Data subset collected from online.
2) Understanding the Data.
3) Loading Libraries.
4) Data Validation, Cleaning & Finding Missing values.
5) Data Visualization.


## DATA CLEANING:
The dataset contains **15,000 rows and 8 columns**. Here are the cleaning steps I took for every column:

- **week column**: This column contains **numeric values** representing the week the sale(s) were made, counted as weeks since product launch. As expected, the values in this column range from **1-6**. There are **no missing values**. **No cleaning was needed**.
- **sales_method column**: This column contains **character values** representing the method of sale used. Before cleaning, there were **5 categories/methods**: Email, Email + Call, Call, em + call, and email. I realized that the sales_method column had misspelled values and some categories represented the same sales methods. The two categories/methods that were misspelled were "**em + call" and "email**". **Cleaning was necessary** for this column.I fixed this problem by replacing "**em + call" with "Email + Call**" and replacing "**email" with "Email**" respectively. Now the dataset was left with **three** unique sales methods:  **Email, Call, and Email + Call**. There are **no missing values** in this column. 
- **customer_id column**: This column contains **character values** representing the unique ID that a customer is given after a successful sale. Same as the description. Customer IDs are supposed to serve as unique identifiers for individual customers which allow businesses to distinguish and differientate between customers. There were **13,926** unique customer ids after the missing values were dropped (15,000 unique customer_ids  with missing values included). **No values were missing from this column, and no cleaning was necessary**.
- **nb_sold column**: This column contains **numeric values** representing the number of products a customer has purchased. Same as the description. The range of values in this column range from **7 to 16 products** sold per customer. There are **no values missing** and **no cleaning was necessary**.
- **revenue column**: This column consists of **numeric values**, rounded to 2 decimals, representing the revenue generated by customers after sales. Among the **15,000 rows, 1,074 rows contained missing values represented as 'NaN'**. Out of the 1,074 missing values, **544 missing values came from the Email method, 349 missing values came from the Email + Call method, and 181 missing values came from the Call method**. I have decided to **drop** these rows without revenue values. I made the judgment that around that roughly 93% left of the remaining filled data would provide a sufficient analysis. After the drop the dataset from having **15,000** rows to having **13,926** rows, with **8 columns**. The range of this column is between **32.54 US Dollars and 238.32 US Dollars**.
- **years_as_customer column**: This column contains **numeric values** representing the number of years a customer has shopped at Pens and Printers. Same as the description. This column contained **two outliers**: The first one is **63 years**, and the second one is **47 years**. Both of these values of customer membership are not possible considering Pens and Printers was founded in **1984**. 63 years, and 47 years date back to **1960 and 1976 respectively, well before 1984**. **These outliers were removed from the dataset** for being **outside the appropriate range**. With the exception of thse outliers, the range of years is between **0 to 39 years**. There are **no missing values** in this column. 
- **nb_site_visits column**: This column contains **numeric values** representing the number of times a customer has visited the website of Pens and Printers in the last six months. Same as the description. The range of the values in this column is between **12 and 41**. There are **no values missing. No cleaning was necessary**.
- **State column**:This column contains **character values** represenrting the state in which a customer is located. Same as the description. I made sure all **50** states were present in the dataset and were spelled correctly in order to avoid inaccurate analysis or a misrepresentation of the data. As expected, **each state was present, spelled correctly and each state value was unique, so there was no change done to this column**.
- **Correct datatypes?**: In order to ensure a proper, accurate analysis and avoid the misrepresentation of data, it is imperative to check the datatypes of the dataset. After review, every column seems to have the appropriate datatyping. Numerical columns are integer or float types, strings/text are object types.

After data cleaning and validation, there are **13,926 rows and 8 columns**.

# Exploratory Analysis

## Q1. How many customers were there for each approach?

**Email** was the most successful sales approach with **6,922** customers/sales, followed by **Call** with **4,781** customers/sales. In last was **Email + Call** with only **2,223** customers/sales. It is imperative to highlight that the 'Email + Call' method is not a sum of the two methods, but rather a separate method that involved the business first sending customers their product information and then following up with a 10 minute call the following week. 

- Total: 13,926 customers **(15,000 with nulls)**

## Q2. What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?

<img width="617" alt="spread1" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/9387811b-e6d1-416f-a28a-a97e766cbd54">
<img width="617" alt="spread2" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/62696f6a-e5c0-41ac-8e32-2d5476d98b75">

**Email + Call**: This method brings in more money on average than the other methods with the largest spread and largest median. Email + Call has an IQR of **$35**

**Email**: This method has the second smallest spread and the median. However,it yields a bunch of extreme values on the right whisker (outliers). Email has an IQR of **$17**

**Call**: This method has the smallest spread and median. Call has an IQR of **$11**.

**Email + Call** appears to be the most rewarding sales method. While the **Email** method produced the most revenue because it was signifcantly used more than the other methods, on average it brings in less revenue than **Email + Call**.

This entails that the **Email + Call** method happens to grab the attention of customers who are not afraid to make very large purchases with the business, most likely very loyal customers since they were encouraged to purchase after being sent an email and a phone call. The **Call** method though it brought in nearly 228,000 USD, simply is not as effective in driving in sales as a sole method and is **by far the worst performing method**

<img width="617" alt="spread3" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/3e21a458-6b29-455f-ae0d-fad92f95440e">

- Overall, the spread of the revenue appears to be **non-normal** and **skewed to the right** with **five** peaks.

## Q3. Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?

<img width="617" alt="spread4" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/4c0f0be3-20d1-43f2-8ecf-5b39e5a410e2">

Yes, through week 1 the **Email** sales method peaked with over 220,000 USD in revenue. However, as the weeks progressed, Email as the sales method **declined** every week and did not yield the revenue it did in week 1. On the other hand, the **Email + Call** method **increased** since week 1 and **peaked** during week 5. Likewise, the call method also **peaked** in week 5, and seemed to slowly grow since week 1 but was not nearly as impressive in growth. 

<img width="617" alt="spread5" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/164a4096-ae0a-4db5-a1fe-254161dc68b5">


## Q4. Which method would you recommend we continue to use?

<img width="617" alt="spread6" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/5cc3672e-7cee-42ec-89f5-39b3996b1c65">

- **Call**: Roughly **227,563** USD

- **Email + Call**: Roughly **408,256** USD

- **Email**: Roughly **672,317** USD

<img width="617" alt="spread6" src="https://github.com/ryessem7/SalesEDA/assets/98337669/93455bc3-afc9-4008-b835-95a1922a2f9d">

- The **Email + Call** method creates more revenue even with the same number of items being sold. This may mean that this method sells products of **higher** retail price.



I recommend that Caliber Supplies should use the **Email + Call** sales approach method as their main way to engage customers and generate revenue.


## Metrics to Monitor

The business metric Caliber Supplies should monitor is **average revenue** of the preferred sales method. The company wants to earn the highest revenue using the best sales method approach, and I believe average revenue is the best way to do that. **Average revenue allows Pens and Printers to analyze the revenue generated per sale/unit.**

Based on my analysis, **Email + Call** method has the highest average sale revenue of **183** USD, which is far greater than Call's **47** USD average and Email's **97** USD average. If the sales team uses the revenue average **183** USD as their **standard**, they will be able to properly gauge **excellent** sales performance (above average) or **subpar** sales performance (below average).

Furthermore, the sales team should understand that overall sale averages and weekly sales averages are two different things because sale averages increase every week.

## Recomendations

- I recommend that Caliber Supplies should use the **Email + Call** sales approach method as their main way to engage customers and generate revenue. Based on the data, the **Email + Call** method has the highest average sales revenue at around **183** USD. In addition, the **Email + Call** method has the best growth potential overtime. 

- I would recommend that the company should consider keeping the **Email** sales method. The implementation of this method is relatively inexpensive, in addition, this method brought in the **most** revenue because it brought in the most customers by far. The company should consider increasing the frequency of their emails to customers to maintain their interest and engagement.

- Lastly, I would recommend that the company completely stops using the **Call** method because it is expensive to execute, it is time-consuming, and it averages the **lowest** revenue amounts.

- Investigate sales tracking system and figure out why only 93% of sales through a six week span were recorded (why were 1,074 values missing?)
